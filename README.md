# Chapter-3
### What I Learned
I learned the fundamentals of Dart programming, including its syntax, variables, and data types such as int, double, String, and bool. I explored control structures like if-else, loops, and switch cases, as well as functions and their role in modular programming. Additionally, I delved into Dart collections, including lists, sets, and maps, which are essential for handling data. Error handling techniques, like using try-catch blocks, were also introduced to manage exceptions effectively.

### Achievement
I successfully built a console-based calculator app that implements Dart basics, demonstrating the ability to use variables, functions, and control structures to create a functional program.
